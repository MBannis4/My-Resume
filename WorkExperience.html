    <li>        Business process outsourcing (BPO) is a method of subcontracting various business-related operations to third-party vendors.
        Although BPO originally applied solely to manufacturing entities, such as soft drink manufacturers that outsourced large segments of their supply chains, BPO now applies to the outsourcing of various products and services.
